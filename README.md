## Ansible + CIS Benchmarks + Windows

This is an ansible playbook for automatically applying CIS Security Benchmarks to a system running Microsoft Windows

### What are these benchmarks?
The [Center for Internet Security](http://www.cisecurity.org/) publishes [security benchmarks](http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/) for various systems.  Refer to the CIS site as the authoritative site for anything regarding these benchmarks.  You can join their community and contribute to the security benchmarks project.
